    <p>Okay hear me out on this.  This beef is totally Mongolian style and that is probably one of the best kinds of cusines out there today.  This dish is made with different ingredients and some of the same ingredients too!</p> 
    <p>There is little to no chance I just picked this recipe at random!  <strong><ins>Lets Get Cooking!</ins></strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p> <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon & 1 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>12 ounces thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>4 ounces carrots</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>8 green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon & 1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon & 1 teaspoon reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon & 1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 dash red pepper flakes</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p> <ol>
        <li>Chop garlic and combine with smaller amount of soy sauce. Stir in smaller amount of cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Cut beef into strips and fold into soy sauce and garlic mixture. Stir to coat meat with sauce. Cover and set aside.</li>

        <li>Fill a large saucepan 3/4 full of water and heat on high until boiling.</li>
        <li>While water is heating, pour oil into a wok or skillet and turn heat on to medium. Place meat strips in oil and stir fry until browned.</li>
        <li>Drain and reserve water from carrots. Add carrots to wok and continue cooking over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the water drained off the carrots, the larger amounts of soy sauce and cornstarch, sesame seeds, sugar and red pepper flakes. Set aside.</li>
